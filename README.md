## Game description

You command the lunar module, which is descending towards the moon's surface.  It is paramount that, at the moment of touch down, the speed be below a safe threshold.  The module accelerates towards the surface due to gravity.  To decelerate, you have at your disposal a limited number of boosters which you must fire at the right moments.

## Game instructions

-   Press the space bar to fire a booster

-   Press 'x' to abort the game

You'll get feedback on your altitude and velocity, the number of fired boosters currently active, the shots remaining, and whether your speed is safe for landing.

## About

The game is written in Haskell and is meant to be run on an ANSI-terminal.  [Click here](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) if you need help building a Haskell program with Cabal.

The idea for the game came to me from a distant childhood memory, whence an uncle showed me this sort of game running on a 1976 [Mag Card HP Calculator](https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp6797.htm) without graphics.
