# Lunar Landing

Your mission: land the lunar module safely on the moon!

## Game description

You command the lunar module, which is descending towards the moon's
surface.  It is paramount that, at the moment of touch down, the speed
be below a safe threshold.  The module accelerates towards the surface
due to gravity.  To decelerate, you have at your disposal a limited
number of boosters which you must fire at the right moments.

## Game instructions

- Press the space bar to fire a booster

- Press 'x' to abort the game

You'll get feedback on your altitude and velocity, the number of fired
boosters currently active, the shots remaining, whether your speed is
safe for landing, as well as a basic graphical representation of the
lunar module's progress.

## About

The game is written in Haskell and is meant to be run on an
ANSI-terminal.  You can build it from the source files in this
repository using [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/).

The idea for the game came to me from a distant childhood memory,
whence an uncle showed me a very primitive version of this sort of
game running on a nifty [Mag Card HP
Calculator](https://www.hpmuseum.org/hp6797.htm) without graphics.
